• Spring Boot helps developers to start coding right away without wasting time on preparing and configuring the environment. </br>

• In contrast to other Java frameworks, it provides flexible XML configurations, robust batch processing, database transactions, easy workflow, along with a wide variety of tools for development. </br>
